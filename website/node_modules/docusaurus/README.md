## Introduction

Docusaurus is a project for easily building, deploying, and maintaining open source project websites.

- **Simple to Start** Docusaurus is built to be easy to [get up and running](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation.html) in as little time possible. We've built Docusaurus to handle the website build process so you can focus on your project.
- **Localizable** Docusaurus ships with [localization support](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/translation.html) via CrowdIn. Empower and grow your international community by translating your documentation.
- **Customizable** While Docusaurus ships with the key pages and sections you need to get started, including a home page, a docs section, a [blog](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/blog.html), and additional support pages, it is also [customizable](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/custom-pages.html) as well to ensure you have a site that is [uniquely yours](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/api-pages.html).

## Installation

Docusaurus is available as the [`docusaurus` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus) on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).

We have also released the [`docusaurus-init` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus-init) to make [getting started](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation.html) with Docusaurus even easier.

## Contributing

We've released Docusaurus because it helps us better scale and support the many OSS projects at Facebook. We hope that other organizations can benefit from the project. We are thankful for any contributions from the community.
