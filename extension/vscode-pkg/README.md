    Restart your terminal.
- Within the `extension/vscode-pkg` folder, run:

        code --install-extension howdoi-0.0.1.vsix

- Add the unpackaged files to your VS Code extensions folder (the path of the folder can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#your-extension-folder)). If no files were created within the `extension/vscode-pkg`, check if the files are in the extension folder path.

- Look over the README within the unpackaged files for more info on how to run howdoi within VS Code.
